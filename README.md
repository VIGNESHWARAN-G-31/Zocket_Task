# Understanding AI Agents 🤖⚙️

## What Are AI Agents? 💡

AI agents are autonomous entities that interact with their environment, perceive information, reason through it, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They rely on AI models to make decisions based on the data they gather and the tasks they are designed to perform.

### **Essential Components of AI Agents**:

1. **Perception**: The ability to gather and process data from the environment, such as sensory inputs (e.g., cameras, microphones) or external data (e.g., API calls). 🧠👀
2. **Reasoning**: The process of analyzing data and making decisions using logic, algorithms, or machine learning models. 🧮💭
3. **Action**: After reasoning, AI agents take action to affect the environment, whether physical (e.g., moving objects) or digital (e.g., sending emails). 🎯🔧
4. **Learning**: AI agents improve their performance over time by learning from experience, using techniques like supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning. 🧑‍🏫📈

## Steps to Design and Implement an AI Agent 👨‍💻🔧

1. **Problem Identification**: Identify the task the AI agent will perform (e.g., web scraping, customer service).
2. **Data Collection**: Gather the necessary data or inputs from the environment (e.g., URLs for web scraping).
3. **Decision Making**: Define the algorithms or models that the agent will use to process data and make decisions.
4. **Action Execution**: Implement the actions the agent will take after processing the data (e.g., sending notifications, updating records).
5. **Testing and Evaluation**: Ensure the agent performs as expected and refine the model or algorithms.

# Practical Implementation: AI Agent for Web Content Summarization 🌐📝

## Task Overview:

Develop an AI agent capable of:
1. Accepting a URL as input.
2. Retrieving and analyzing the content of the provided web link.
3. Extracting key information from the web page.
4. Generating a concise summary of the extracted content.

### **Implementation Steps**:

1. **Accepting URL as Input**:
   - The agent receives a URL through user input.

2. **Retrieving and Analyzing Content**:
   - Use libraries like **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests** to fetch and parse the web page content.

3. **Extracting Key Information**:
   - Implement techniques to identify important sections such as headings, paragraphs.

4. **Generating Summary**:
   - Use a pre-trained **Summarization Model** (e.g., **T5**, **BART**) to generate a concise summary of the page content.

### **Code Sample** (Python):

```import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from transformers import pipeline

# Step 1: Fetch web content
def fetch_web_content(url):
    try:
        headers = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}
        response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=10)
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise exception for HTTP errors
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')

        # Extract paragraphs
        paragraphs = soup.find_all('p')
        content = ' '.join([p.get_text() for p in paragraphs if p.get_text()])

        # Add headings if too short
        if len(content) < 1000:
            headings = soup.find_all(['h1', 'h2', 'h3', 'h4', 'h5', 'h6'])
            content += ' '.join([h.get_text() for h in headings if h.get_text()])

        return content[:3500]  # Limit to 3500 characters to avoid overloading the model
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        return f"⚠️ Error fetching content: {e}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"⚠️ Unexpected error: {e}"

# Step 2: Format summary into sections
def format_summary(text):
    # Use summarizer
    summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=600, min_length=300, do_sample=False)[0]['summary_text']

    # Basic structure separation (you can customize this further using NLTK or GPT)
    intro = summary.split(". ")[0:2]
    highlights = summary.split(". ")[2:6]
    insights = summary.split(". ")[6:8]
    conclusion = summary.split(". ")[8:]

    # Format output
    return f"""
📄 Summary:

📝 **Summary of the Article**

📚 **Introduction**
{' '.join(intro)}.

⚡ **Main Highlights**
- {highlights[0]}.
- {highlights[1]}.
- {highlights[2]}.
- {highlights[3]}.

💡 **Additional Insights**
{' '.join(insights)}.

✨ **Conclusion**
{' '.join(conclusion)}.
""".strip()

# Step 3: AI Agent Function
def ai_agent(url):
    content = fetch_web_content(url)
    if "⚠️" in content:
        return content
    return format_summary(content)

# Main entry
if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_url = input("🔗 Enter a URL to summarize: ")
    result = ai_agent(user_url)
    print(result)
